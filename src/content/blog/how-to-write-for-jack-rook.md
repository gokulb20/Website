Every essay in The Library follows the same structure. Not because we lack creativity, but because constraints breed clarity. Here's how to contribute.

## The Format

Each post is a markdown file with a specific header. Copy this template:

```

title: "Your Title Here"
date: 2026-01-15
category: "competence"

Your content starts here.

## The Three Categories

Every essay must fit one pillar:

**Competence** — Skills, craft, expertise. How to do things well. Articles about building capability, mastering disciplines, and developing practical knowledge.

**Composure** — Emotional regulation, stress management, presence. How to remain steady. Articles about mental resilience, handling pressure, and maintaining equilibrium.

**Character** — Values, integrity, principles. Who to become. Articles about ethics, decision-making, and building a reputation worth having.

If your topic spans multiple categories, choose the dominant one. Ambiguity weakens impact.

## The Voice

Write like you're explaining something to a younger version of yourself. Direct, but not condescending. Confident, but not arrogant.

Avoid:
- Jargon that obscures rather than clarifies
- Excessive qualifiers ("I think maybe perhaps...")
- Apologies for having an opinion
- Generic advice that could apply to anyone

Embrace:
- Concrete examples over abstract principles
- Personal experience where relevant
- Strong positions, clearly stated
- The occasional well-placed quote

## The Structure

Most essays follow this pattern:

1. **Hook** — Start with a statement or observation that creates tension
2. **Context** — Why this matters, what's at stake
3. **Framework** — Your main insight or approach, broken into digestible parts
4. **Application** — How the reader can use this today
5. **Close** — A memorable final thought

You don't need headers for short pieces. For longer essays, use them to create natural breaks.

## Finding Images

Use Unsplash.com for free, high-quality images. Search for:
- Professional settings
- Masculine aesthetics (leather, wood, clean lines)
- Nature and solitude
- Craftsmanship

Add `?w=600&q=80` to the end of any Unsplash URL for optimized loading.

## Before You Publish

Ask yourself:

1. Would I want to read this?
2. Does it teach something actionable?
3. Is this advice I'd give my own son?
4. Have I removed every unnecessary word?

If yes to all four, it's ready.

## The Workflow

1. Write your draft anywhere (Notes, Google Docs, etc.)
2. Format it with the template above
3. Save as `your-title-here.md` in `src/content/blog/`
4. Push to GitHub
5. Netlify deploys automatically in ~60 seconds

That's it. No approval process, no committees. Write something worth reading, and publish it.
